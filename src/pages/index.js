    responsibility to throw the perfect bachelor party, on the morning of the

    <p>People say that they fear public speaking more than almost anything else
    in life. In this article I'm going to give you a few tips I that will turn
    your best man speech into something memorable. With these tips, I assure
    you, you won't embarrass yourself in front of the wedding party.
    </p>
    <p>The ideal wedding speech should be around four minutes. Normally, in
    addition to the best man’s wedding toast, the father of the bride, the
    groom, and maid of honor give speeches. The father of the bride speech
    should be first. His speech should consist of welcoming the groom to the
    family and wishes of good luck to the bride and groom. The groom speaks
    next, taking time to thank his family and friends for coming to the wedding
    and bringing gifts. The best man’s speech follows the groom’s wedding
    speech. The best man’s speech should be a funny speech that talks about
    the groom’s past and how he has changed for the better since meeting his
    bride, which is why it's so memorable to the audience. Finally, the maid of
    honor’s speech is a short speech that signals time to get back to the dancing.
    </p>
    <p>If you’ve been asked to be someone’s best man at their wedding it may
    seem like a dubious honour when you think about having to give a speech in
    front of so many people. Below are some simple tips to follow to ensure that

    <h1>Best Man Speech Tips</h1>
    <h4><b>Tip 1</b>: Stand up while speaking</h4>
    <p>Always, always stand up when giving a best man speech or a toast. Make
    sure you have everybody's attention before you speak. The best way to do
    that is to stand up and wait for them to be quiet. Standing up is the first
    rule of any good public speaking and a wedding is no different. They will
    be expecting your speech and it is often customary to tap the side of your
    glass with a fork to ensure you get everyone’s attention.
    </p>
    <h4><b>Tip 2</b>: Plan what you want to say</h4>
    <p>Never try and wing it on the day. A best man speech needs to be planned and
    written down well in advance. Unless you are a really proficient public
    speaker, you will need to plan to make sure you say everything  that you
    want to say. Write it down, but don’t write the full speech - otherwise
    there is a high chance it will come across as wooden and unnatural. Play
    around with what works best works for you, but many people prefer to print
    bullet points of all the major parts of the speech on a piece of paper to
    use as a reference tool when necessary.
    </p>
    <h4><b>Tip 3</b>: Practice makes perfect!</h4>
    <p>Practice your speech until you know it by heart. There is nothing worse
    than giving a best man speech and having to look down at your notes every 2
    words. Also, fidgeting with paper is out! You can discreetly look at your
    notes from time to time, but don’t be that guy who just reads a multi page
    speech word for word - we’ve all seen them and we didn’t enjoy their speech!
    </p>
    <h4><b>Tip 4</b>: Keep it clean</h4>
    <p>Funny and vulgar are two different things. A lot of people, tend to think
    that to be funny you have to be vulgar and rude and embarrassing, this is
    absolutely not true. If you and the groom have had some wild times together,
    this is not the time to tell his new family. Some people think that giving
    a best man speech gives them the right to embarrass the groom and upset the
    bride - this is totally wrong. Don't mention the time the groom made a fool
    of himself at the strip joint or anything like that.
    </p>
    <h4><b>Tip 5</b>: Keep it short</h4>
    <p>No one wants to be bored for hours with your speech. Make it short and
    to the point and don't forget to add emotion when giving your speech. The
    wedding isn't about you, it's about the bride and groom.
    </p>

    <h5>Longer Speech Ideas</h5>
    <blockquote>Thanks to all of you for coming today and sharing this special
    occasion with Jane and Tom. Tom and I have been friends for years and I am
    so happy to see him marry such a wonderful woman. Ever since Tom met Jane,
    I’ve never seen one without the other. Their love for each other has only
    grown stronger even during tough times. Thank you, Tom, for being such a
    good friend. I wish you and Jane the best of everything as you share long
    and happy lives. Cheers!
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Now it is my great honor and privilege to make the first toast
    to Arnold and Vanessa as husband and wife. While some people know that
    Arnold and I went to high school and college together, few are aware that
    we first met while playing Little League baseball in grade school. Arnold
    played for the Avondale Americans and I played for their arch rival, the
    Boonetown Buddies. I was pitching during the final game of the season when
    Arnold hit a grand slam home run. He ran the bases like a demon and scored
    the winning run, crushing my ego for years.
    While that embarrassment was temporary, the positive impression Arnold made
    on me later as a classmate, teammate, roommate and friend will last forever.
    Arnold has always been there for me. He is honest, caring, thoughtful and
    an all round great guy. Heck, if I was a woman, we’d be the ones getting
    married today!
    But seriously, I think he’s made a much better choice in Vanessa. Let us
    toast them and wish them a long life together filled with love and laughter.
    May their joys be many and their sadnesses few. Congratulations!
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>After 25 years of sibling rivalry, you can see that my brother
    has finally figured out who the best man really is. I wish James and
    Jennifer all the best now and forever. As you go through life together,
    always love each other, respect each other and be there for each other.
    Remember to say “I’m sorry” when you mess up and never go to bed angry.
    Separately, you’re both wonderful people, but together you take life to a
    new level. I love you both. Congratulations!
